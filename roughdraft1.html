                <p>I have four certifications: Network+, Security+, AWS Cloud Practioner, Azure Fundamentals. Also throughout this website, many if not all the back</p>

                <h3>Golf</h3>
                <p>I started playing when I was 7 and have continued to play. I like playing with my golf teamates and we won CIF champions when I was a junior in high school.</p>

                <h3>Teaching</h3>
                <p>Whether it be mentoring academically or tutoring in math, I love to teach when I have the chance. At my high school, I enjoyed teaching students Cybersecurity! To spread my reach, I even created a youtube channel to share my IT exam strategies and how I studied. The link is in the footer.</p>

                <p>Computer Science is my intended major. I have practiced coding dashboards, eccomerce website, and many more. This website is also one that I made.</p>

                <h3>M-theory</h3>
                <p>As an IT Intern I was able to learn about how great M-theory was as a managed service provider. I met fantastic people, who were really friendly, and learned a lot about work culture. I was given the opportunity to contribute with presetting some products to be delivered to our customers. My biggest project involved an inventory management software which I learned and introduced to our procurement team. Now, to better contribute to M-theory, I am studying for Azure certifications as we hope to take full advantage of cloud technology</p>

                <h3>Curacao</h3>
                <p>I am super grateful to be given another opportunity to work as an IT intern about Curacao. I was able to learn from the front-end engineers at the company and observed the talent up close. They delegated the task for me to test their websites and scrutinize over signs of user frustration and other areas of improvement. I was able to provide good feedback to improve in hopes of reducing spam clicking and confusion for our customers. My supervisors were super friendly as they gave me small projects to learn front-end engineering </p>

                <h3>Mathnasium</h3>
                <p>When school came around, I could no longer be an intern, so I decided to find a different part-time job. Introduced by a family friend, Mathnasium provided me with a math tutoring opportunity. There I was not only able to sharpen by existing math skills, but I learned teaching methods that work for different students. Many times, a specific way that I looked at a problem worked best for most people, but I had to think about alternate methods for other students.</p>

                <h3>Projects</h3>
                <p>Part of my project is this website and I hope to put my knowledge from certifications to practical experiences. From this website, I hope to stem out to other coding projects that will include backend and host them on Azure to have global reach. Some of my projects hope to address a need in the world. For example, I will want to code a website for christians around the world to connect with other christians with similar interests. I am also thinking of having clubs at my high school be spotlighted by my websites. I also might want to make an educational website or even a blog post to share my knowledge. Lastly, as a learning but practical experience I want to utilize cybersecurity and see if I can find exploits on my website.</p>
